            <h2>Welcome to Palestine</h2>
            <p>When we talk about breakfast, I don’t mean cereal with milk. I am talking about real Palestinian food: zait and zatar (thyme, a local spice) with olive oil, falafel, hummus, and taboun (fresh bread baked over a bonfire).

 

We could talk for days about the lunch options. I am going to concentrate on Musakhan, one of the most familiar Palestinian meals, which is made out of fresh-baked taboun bread dipped into olive oil, topped with chopped onion and mixed with sumac (another local spice), with a piece of meat or chicken added to the top, and baked in the wood fire oven.

 

I am sure the dinner requires more space than our stomachs can handle, but if there was enough space, nothing can compare to the salads that are served such as Arabic Salad, Baba Ghanouj, hummus, t-hineh salad, fateh, and more. By the way, any of these salads are great just before the main barbecue dish!

Music

Dating back to 10,000 BC, in the area of Bethlehem, is where scholars and researchers at the end of the 20th Century found what is believed to be the real first human experience with fire, in a cave called “Um Katfa” in the St. Chariton (Khreton) Valley. Can you imagine the people who lived since then – two, three, or even four thousand years ago – gathered around the fire to sing and play music? Of course, they used very basic ways to express music (unlike today’s stunning instruments), however, our ancestors built up the base for almost everything we as humans do today. The Canaanites introduced the world to fire, and we could also be the ones who introduced the world to the first X-Factor or Idol shows!

 

When it comes to music, we Palestinians have our own heritage of folklore dances and music, including our traditional dance, the Dabkeh. We have some rare instruments that only Palestinian use, like the Shubabe and Yarghoul, and our singers are famous for the Zajal.
